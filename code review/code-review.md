## **Some files that caught my attention**


## 1. reportWebVitals.js file

+ **Purpose:** This code is designed to measure and report web performance metrics known as Web Vitals.
+**Dynamic import usage:** The code uses dynamic import (import('web-vitals')) to load the web-vitals library only when needed, which can improve the initial performance of the application.
Metric functions: Five specific Web Vitals functions are being used:

+ getCLS: Cumulative Layout Shift
+ getFID: First Input Delay
+ getFCP: First Contentful Paint
+ getLCP: Largest Contentful Paint
+ getTTFB: Time to First Byte


+ **Flexibility:** The reportWebVitals function accepts an onPerfEntry parameter, suggesting it's configurable and can be used with different callbacks for reporting metrics.
+ **Safety check:** There's a verification to ensure onPerfEntry is a function before proceeding, which adds a layer of security and error prevention.
+ **Modularity:** The code is structured as an exportable module, indicating it's likely part of a larger application, possibly a React application.
+ **Performance focus:** The inclusion of these metrics suggests a focus on optimizing and monitoring web application performance.


## 2. Wheather Forecast

<image max-with="80% vh" src="/images/wheather_forecast.jpg" alt="wheather forecast">

+ **Purpose:** This code defines a class called WeatherForecast, which appears to be a data model for storing weather information.

+ **Properties:**

+ Date: A DateOnly property to store the date of the forecast.
TemperatureC: An integer property to store the temperature in Celsius.
+ TemperatureF: A read-only property that calculates the temperature in Fahrenheit based on the Celsius value.
+ Summary: A nullable string property to store a brief description of the weather.


+ **Temperature Conversion:** The TemperatureF property uses a formula to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit (F = 32 + (C / 0.5556)). This is implemented as an expression-bodied member.
+ **Nullability:** The Summary property is marked as nullable (string?), indicating that it can have a null value.
Access Modifiers: All properties are public, allowing full access from outside the class.
+ **Lack of Constructor:** There's no explicit constructor defined, meaning the class will use the default parameterless constructor.

This class is likely used as a data transfer object (DTO) or model in a weather forecasting API. It provides a structured way to represent weather data, including both Celsius and Fahrenheit temperatures, which is useful for international applications.

## 1. Robots.txt

<image max-with="80% vh" src="/images/robots_txt.jpg" alt="robots.txt">

+ **Purpose:** This file is used to communicate with web crawlers and search engine bots about which parts of the website they are allowed to access and index.
+ Content:
CopyUser-agent: *
Disallow:

### Meaning:

+ User-agent: * applies the rules to all web crawlers.
+ Disallow: with no value after it means no restrictions are placed on the crawlers.


+ **Implications:** This configuration allows all search engines and web crawlers to access and index all parts of the website.
Openness: The site owner is not restricting any content from being crawled, which can be good for SEO but might not be suitable if there are private areas of the site.
Simplicity: This is the most basic and permissive robots.txt configuration possible.

This configuration essentially tells search engines, "You're welcome to crawl our entire site." It's common for public-facing websites that want maximum visibility in search results.
