# TEST PLAN

## Scope:

### Backend (C# APIs):

User authentication
Product management
Order processing

### Frontend:

ReactJS: User authentication and dashboard
Aurelia: Product listing and order processing

## Objectives:

Verify the functionality of all API endpoints
Ensure proper integration between frontend and backend
Validate user authentication and authorization processes
Confirm accurate product management operations
Verify order processing workflow
Test responsiveness and performance of frontend applications
Ensure cross-browser compatibility
Validate data integrity and security

## Resources:

### Testing environments:

Development server
Staging server
Local development environment

### Testing tools:

Postman for API testing
Selenium WebDriver for frontend automation
JMeter for performance testing
Chrome DevTools for frontend debugging

### Test data:

Sample user accounts
Product catalog
Order history

### Documentation:

API documentation
Frontend component specifications


## Risks and Mitigation Strategies:

Risk: Integration issues between C# backend and ReactJS/Aurelia frontends
Mitigation: Conduct thorough integration testing and implement proper error handling
Risk: Performance bottlenecks in high-load scenarios
Mitigation: Perform load testing and optimize critical paths
Risk: Security vulnerabilities in user authentication
Mitigation: Implement penetration testing and follow security best practices
Risk: Cross-browser compatibility issues
Mitigation: Test on multiple browsers and versions, use responsive design principles

## Deliverables:

Comprehensive test cases document
Test execution results and reports
Defect log with severity and priority classifications
Performance test results and analysis
Security assessment report
User acceptance testing (UAT) sign-off document
